        <h1>Naval Warfare during the Steam Age</h1>
        <p>
            In the middle of the 19th century, a revolution in naval warfare occured, primarily with the 
            steam engine. Steam propulsion was faster than sails, didn't rely on specific wind conditions,
            and made controlling ships easier. Metal also began to replace wood in hull construction.
            Steam engines could provide enough power to drive metal ships, and the increasing use of 
            fire-causing shells made wood too dangerous to be used anymore. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Innovations in weaponry also drastically changed the nature of naval warfare. The invention
            of barbettes and turrets, which could rotate and protect crew, shifted the focus of armament 
            from numbers to size. Furthermore, improvements in accuracy allowed their use at longer ranges.
            The ship-of-the-line was now replaced by the battleship, and smaller classes were replaced by
            new types like cruisers. The invention of the torpedo, an underwater projectile, gave rise to 
            vast fleets of small torpedo boats that resembled galleys, only that they now posed a legitimate
            threat to battleships. They were quickly superceded in their fast-attack role by destroyers,
            which were designed as escort ships to counter small boats and also carried torpedoes themselves.

            At the beginning of the 20th century, the refinement of submarines and aircraft for use in 
            war added a new layer of complexity to naval warfare. The start of World War I saw the first
            formulations and usage of new fleet tactics accomodating the metal-clad steam-powered warship.
