        <h2>Fifth-Rate</h2>
        <p>
            Fifth-rates were the main type of frigates used by the Royal Navy, operated by crews of 200 to
            300 men. Older fifth-rates had 40 to 44 cannons in two decks. However, the French 
            "classic frigate" with its one deck proved to be superior in frigate duties, so the British 
            soon switched designs. Fifth-rates could have a variety of gun arrangements: ships of the 
            1750s had 12-pounder cannons with 6-pounders on the top decks, while heavier ships of the
            1770s carried 18-pounders with 6 and 9-pounders on the top decks. They fulfilled most of the 
            duties expected of frigates: scouting, battle messaging, and commerce raiding. By the end
            of the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy had 134 fifth-rates.
