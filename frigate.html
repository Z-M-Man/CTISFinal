        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The frigate type of ship can be traced to a galley-type warship, driven by oars and lightly 
            armed. In 1853, privateers known as the "Dunkirkers" developed small, maneuverable ships to
            attack Dutch shipping. These were the first sailing ships to be referred to as "frigates."
            Soon, the Dutch themselves built larger frigates that were able to travel oceans. These ships
            were used with great success, and soon other European navies started to adopt similar designs.
            The French developed a frigate design with one cannon deck and a lower hull, giving it 
            greatly improved agility. The British captured some of these French ships and based many of 
            their own frigates on those.

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            While early frigates varied in design, the French "true frigate" is the most well-known 
            and widely used during the Napoleonic Wars. The frigate's fast speed made it both a great 
            escort against privateer ships and a formidable shipping raider itself. In a battle between
            ship of the lines, frigates would avoid direct combat with any larger ship; instead, they 
            served as scouts and relayed messages from the flagship to the rest of the fleet. 
            Smaller fourth-rate ships were sometimes informally referred to as "frigates."
