        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The ship of the line has its origins in the carrack, a large sailing ship widely adopted in 
            the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Its tall freeboard and large size gave it an advantage
            over the small oar-powered galleys common at that time, especially after the introduction of
            gunpowder-based weapons. However, the tall foremast, initially designed to allow archers to 
            shoot at other ships, was soon found to hinder the sailing quality of the ship. Thus, it was 
            replaced by the galleon, which had a shorter foremast and a longer body. It was more agile than
            the carrack while retaining the ability to have many powerful cannons.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 17th century, the line-of-battle became an increasingly popular tactic. A fleet would
            line up single-file so that every ship had their broadside aimed towards the enemy. The winner
            would usually depend on which fleet was able to withstand fire for longer, so ships had to be
            able to both carry and withstand heavy firepower. Thus, the ship of the line was born, and an
            arms race began between navies trying to build increasingly large and powerful ships.

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Ships of the line carried their cannons on at least two decks, with the largest ones having 
            three or even four decks. Hundreds of crew operated dozens of cannons. Under the British system,
            ships were classified under "rates" depending on crew, size, and cannons, with first through 
            fourth-rates being ships of the line. As their name suggests, their purpose was to engage 
            enemy fleets in a line of battle. Admirals would usually assign a first or second-rate ship 
            to be their flagship for a battle.
