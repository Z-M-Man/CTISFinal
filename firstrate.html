        <h2>First-Rate</h2>
        <p>
            First-rate ships were the most powerful warships in the Royal Navy. They were defined as
            having at least 100 cannons (usually across three decks) and over 800 crew members. 32-pounders
            were installed on the lowest gun deck, while 24-pounders were installed in the middle-deck and
            24 or 18-pounders in the third deck. Lighter guns, like carronades, were placed on the top decks.
            These large ships were extremely expensive to maintain, so they were usually left in reserve during
            peacetime and only sent out when war broke out. Still, costs were so high that by the end of
            the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, only eight first-rates were commissioned in the Royal Navy. 
            They were much more influential as symbols, with navies often being compared by their
            first-rates (or comparable large ships).
