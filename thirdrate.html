        <h2>Third-Rate</h2>
        <p>
            Third-rates had a crew of 500-650 and between 64 and 80 cannons between two decks. They were
            the most popular kind of warship, not only in the Royal Navy but in several nations, due to
            them having the best compromises in design. They were cheap and maneuverable but had an
            armament similar in type to second-rates, retaining a decent amount of firepower. The Royal 
            Navy had 103 third-rates by 1814, demonstrating the design's popularity. The most common 
            type of third rate was the "seventy-four," which carried 74 guns. First used by the French,
            it quickly caught on with the British and other European navies, before being outclassed 
            by better shipbuilding methods after the end of the Napoleonic Wars.
