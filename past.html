        <h1>Naval Warfare in the Past</h1>
        <p>
            The first warships were used by Ancient Egypt. The galley, a long and narrow ship driven by
            oars, was invented in Crete and became the only type of warship used by many ancient 
            civilizations. The primary strategy of galleys was to either ram and sink enemy ships or 
            get close enough to board and fight the enemy crew. The galleys could also double as merchant
            ships when not used for fighting. In the 4th century BC, the invention
            of catapults led some ships to be equipped with seige engines--a precursor to the cannon 
            ship. Around the late 3rd century, ramming became less popular as a tactic and was eventually
            abandoned.

            The invention of cannons and other gunpowder guns was, at first, beneficial for galleys.
            Early cannons had a very short effective range and a long reload, which allowed the fast
            galley to close the distance and fire a lethal shot before the enemy could reload in time.
            Boarding still remained one of the main strategies, especially in large fleet battles where
            the galleys would inevitably run into each other. 
        </p>    

        <p>
            In the 15th and 16th century, cannons began to be installed in greater numbers and on the 
            side of ships. However, shortcomings in the cannons themselves meant that galleys still 
            dominated the seas. This changed with the development of the man-of-war, a large ship 
            heavily armed with cannons. To accomodate for the extra weight, the cannons were moved 
            lower into the decks that would normally hold cargo. Not only did this make them more dangerous
            to the smaller galleys, it also meant that the man-of-war was completely dedicated to combat
            and could not be used for merchant activities outside of war, a first in warships. Thus, ships
            began to be built exclusively as warships, and the galley was slowly replaced by the man-of-war
            as the primary ship of navies.
