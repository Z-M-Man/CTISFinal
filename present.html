        <h1>Naval Warfare during the Age of Sail</h1>
        <p class="context">
            Although the use of cannons mounted onships was first started centuries before this period, 
            using them against other ships was very uncommon due to various shortcomings in the 
            technology. It was not until the 16th century that cannon-based warfare became common, and
            battle strategies revolving around this style of combat were only established in the 17th century.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the rise of the heavily-armed man-of-wars in the 16th century, new naval strategies
            had to be devised in order to accomodate these ships. Thus emerged the "line of battle" 
            tactic. This tactic involved a fleet of heavily-armed ships, like a man-of-war, in a 
            single file line. They would sail broadside to enemy ships and fire together, overwhelming
            the enemy through sheer firepower. A consequence of this strategy was that the size of 
            ships became the most important factor. Larger ships could carry more cannons and withstand
            more hits, which was necessary for a line of battle to succeed. Small ships, designed for 
            one-on-one combat, became increasingly obsolete in navies.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Portugeuse were the first to experiment with this tactic, in the 16th century. The British
            are commonly credited with establishing it as their main battle strategy, although the Dutch
            have their own claim. Nevertheless, almost every European navy had adopted the line of battle
            by the 18th century. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The French Navy took a slightly different approach to the line of battle. French commanders 
            often focused on strategic accomplishments rather than winning a tactical battle. While 
            ships of other nations focused on firing into the hull and taking out the crew, French ships
            focused on disabling the rigging of enemies, allowing them to escape and continue with a
            mission at the cost of sustaining more casualties.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the mid-18th century, the weaknesses of relying on line-of-battle tactics began to show.
            Many battles between French and British lines ended inconclusively due to equal numbers on 
            both sides. While intial attempts to innovate were suppressed by high-ranking officials, 
            the American Revolution and the French Revolution saw numerous advancements in technology and
            strategy. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Further improvements in cannons, like new types of guns, flintlocks for more control, and
            larger fields of fire gave British ships a technological advantage over their French enemies.
            The British also found that a return to close-quarters brawling (melee) was very effective against
            a line if done correctly. Towards the end of the Age of Sail, an increasing number of battles 
            involved the defenders waiting in port for the attackers, a strategy that greatly benefited the 
            defending side.
