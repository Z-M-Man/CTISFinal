      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of the 17th century, cannons had been improved enough to be able to reload
           fast enough to be reused in the same battle. Warships equipped with cannons to fight other ships
           soon emerged, changing the nature of naval warfare. Ships of various crew sizes and armament 
           were used, necessitating a classification system for both administrative and military purposes.
        </p>

        <p>As the largest and most powerful naval force in the world, the Royal Navy of Great Britain
           needed a system to properly organize its vessels. The size and number of guns carried on a
           ship determined the size of the crew, and thus the amount of pay and rations allocated for
           them. Ship classifications also indicated a ship's ability and role in battle strategy. 
        </p>

        <p>The Royal Navy had used various classification systems over the decades. With the rapid 
           innovation in designs and strategies, these systems were constantly updated and replaced.
           In 1677, Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Admirality, revised the structure of the system, and
           his design formed the basis of the British system until the era of steel warships. However,
           even Pepys' structure underwent many changes over a century, again reflecting the fluid 
           nature of naval warfare during this period.

        <p id="about">
         This website mainly focuses on Pepys' classification system for the Royal Navy, as it has
         the most documentation and influence in history. The specifc classes featured here are based
         on the version used during the Napoleonic Wars, before the last two revisions in 1817 and 1856.
