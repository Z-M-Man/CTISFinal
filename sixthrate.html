        <h2>Sixth-Rate</h2>
        <p>
            Sixth-rates were older, smaller frigates and the smallest warship classified under the 
            British "Rating" system. They only carried 20-24 cannons and a crew of 140-160. Sixth-rates 
            in the early 18th century were equipped with 6-pounders, but 9-pounders soon replaced them
            mid-century. As with fifth-rates, they were assigned to escorting convoys and overseas 
            stations. By the time of the Napoleonic Wars, they were too small to carry out frigate duties
            expected of them and mostly phased out. About 25 of them lasted to 1814, still serving in 
            auxiliary roles like escorting.
