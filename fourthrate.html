        <h2>Fourth-Rate</h2>
        <p>
            Fourth-rates were the smallest kind of warship to be considered ships of the line, having 
            only 50-60 guns between two decks and 320-420 crew members. Their cannon calibers were quite
            small, having 24-pounders on the lower deck, 12-pounders on the upper deck, and 6-pounders
            on the top decks. During the early decades of the Age of Sail, they were common in lines of 
            battle, as larger ships were not in service yet. However, by 1756, the smaller fourth-rates 
            were considered too weak for lines, and relegated to convoy escorts and overseas stations. 
            Larger 60-gun ships remained as ships of the line, although they would play a mostly 
            supportive role and avoid heavy fighting. During the Napoleonic Wars, some fourth-rates were 
            active, mostly in the shallow North Sea; 10 fourth-rates were still in commission by 1814.
