        <h2>Second-Rate</h2>
        <p>
            Second-rate ships were powerful ships that could be considered lighter and cheaper versions
            of first-rates. A typical crew size was about 700-750 members. They carried 80-100 guns of 
            lighter caliber than first-rates: 32-pounders on the lowest gun deck, 18-pounders on the 
            middle deck, and 12-pounders on the third deck. Lighter guns like carronades were still 
            carried on the topmost decks. They were still considered powerful enough to participate in a
            line of battle, but they were also used as flagships in overseas colonies--a task considered
            too risky for first-rates. Being shorter than first-rates while having the same number of 
            desks, they became notorious for being slow and cumbersome; a problem so prevalent that by
            1814, only seven second-rates were still in commission. In the final decades of sail after the
            Napoleonic Wars, they were downsized to have only two decks.
